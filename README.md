# Flavors of sorts

Your algorithms adventure starts here! For this exercise you need to implement different sorting methods, and understand their respective pros / cons.

In each case your method receives an array full of numbers in random order, and sorts it in place (obviously without using `Array.prototype.sort()`).

Here you find a list of videos that explain how each sorting algorithm works. Just click on their respective images to watch them. Then implement them one by one, in the order theyâ€™re presented.
